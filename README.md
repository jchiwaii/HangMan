## About The Project

Welcome to Hangman! In this game, you will guess a word by choosing letters one by one. If you guess a letter correctly, it will appear in its corresponding position in the word. If you guess incorrectly, you will lose a life. The game ends when you have guessed the entire word or when you have run out of lives.

## Features

Three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard.
A word list containing over 100 English words, categorized by topic.
Hints for each level of difficulty to help you guess the word.
Customizable art and stages to display the hangman.
Responsive design to fit any screen size.
User-friendly interface to make the game easy to play.
